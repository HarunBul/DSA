/*
 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin:
 * 
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on 
 * the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin 
 * (0, 0).
 * 
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance 
 * (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be 
 * unique (except for the order that it is in).
